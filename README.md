Dear members,

This is the UBRobotics GitHub repository where you can find our custom libraries to use and edit, as well as example Arduino sketches for them and code used in previous competitions.

To import a library into the Arduino IDE: (Sketch --> Include Library --> Add .ZIP Library --> Select FOLDER).

Prototype code contains sketches that experiment with different features of the robots and libraries.

Remember, some of the libraries have other custom libraries as requirement, check that you have them installed before you compile the code.

For ease of use you can change the Arduino IDE sketch folder to the 'Arduino' folder of this library.
